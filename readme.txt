As our passion project, we want the core functionality
of our app to be a procedurally-generated retro 
platformer game written from scratch in vanilla 
JavaScript. We have only done work on the game for now,
and will start work on the rest once we are content with
the state of the game.

In order to tick the rest of the boxes, our idea was to
have a few supporting pages such as Home, About, and 
Leaderboard. All of these pages will be  served as a 
single page app written in Vue, with a retro look 
inspired by 1970s/1980s arcades. The leaderboard will 
tick our Server/Database/Dynamic boxes, and we're 
thinking of simulating submitting scores the way 
arcades did it (once you reach the end of the game, 
you get a number of points and are asked for a three 
letter name such as MRC or ALX to submit).
